**COCO Stuff 10k: Common Objects in Context Stuff 10k** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 10000 images with 74616 labeled objects belonging to 183 different classes including *unlabeled*, *person*, *tree*, and other: *wall-other*, *sky-other*, *grass*, *building-other*, *clouds*, *road*, *chair*, *pavement*, *car*, *structural-other*, *dining table*, *fence*, *window-other*, *cup*, *ground-other*, *plant-other*, *bottle*, *bush*, *ceiling-other*, *furniture-other*, *light*, *bowl*, *table*, *dirt*, *door-stuff*, and 155 more.

Images in the COCO Stuff 10k dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (1000 images) and *train* (9000 images)The dataset was released in 2018 by the University of Edinburgh, UK and Google AI Perception.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
