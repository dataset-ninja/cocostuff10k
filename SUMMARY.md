**COCO-Stuff 10K Dataset: Common Objects in Context Stuff 10k v1.1** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 10000 images with 228313 labeled objects belonging to 183 different classes including *unlabeled*, *person*, *tree*, and other: *wall-other*, *sky-other*, *grass*, *building-other*, *clouds*, *road*, *pavement*, *chair*, *car*, *structural-other*, *dining table*, *fence*, *window-other*, *ground-other*, *cup*, *plant-other*, *bottle*, *bush*, *ceiling-other*, *furniture-other*, *light*, *bowl*, *table*, *dirt*, *door-stuff*, and 155 more. There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (1000 images) and *train* (9000 images). Additionally, images have ***caption*** tags, while objects contain ***category*** tags with information about labels hierarchy. Explore them in supervisely. The dataset was released in 2017 by the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom and Google AI Perception.

Here is a visualized example for 25 randomly selected sample classes:
